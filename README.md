# msba_project

This is a repository containing three data analytics projects completed as part of the UMN MSBA program. Each project includes Jupyter notebooks and associated data files.

## Project 1: Analyze Disparities in Standard Testing
This project analyzed disparities in standardized test scores between different demographic groups. The project included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and statistical analysis using Python and various libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and scipy. The analysis revealed significant disparities in test scores among different demographic groups and provided insights into potential reasons for these disparities.

## Project 2: Project 2: Customer Lifetime Value Prediction
The second project focused on predicting customer lifetime value (CLV) for a fictional e-commerce company. The project utilized machine learning techniques such as linear regression, random forests, and XGBoost to create a predictive model based on customer purchase history. The project also included feature engineering and data visualization using Python and libraries such as scikit-learn and matplotlib.

## Project 3: Spam Email
The third project involved building a machine learning model to classify spam emails. The project utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as feature extraction, tokenization, and stemming to preprocess the email data. The project then utilized machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and naive Bayes to classify the emails as spam or not spam. The project was implemented using Python and libraries such as nltk, scikit-learn, and pandas.
