# msba_project

This is a repository containing three data analytics projects completed as part of the UMN MSBA program. Each project includes Jupyter notebooks and associated data files.

## Project 1: Analyze Disparities in Standard Testing
This project analyzed disparities in standardized test scores between different demographic groups. The project included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and statistical analysis using Python and various libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and scipy. The analysis revealed significant disparities in test scores among different demographic groups and provided insights into potential reasons for these disparities.

## Project 2: Project 2: Customer Lifetime Value Prediction
The second project focused on predicting customer lifetime value (CLV) of credict card user for a banking industry. The project utilized machine learning techniques such as Bridge Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network to create a predictive model based on customer history. The project also included feature engineering and data visualization using Python and libraries such as scikit-learn and matplotlib.

## Project 3: Spam Email
The third project involved building two different machine learning models for detecting and classify spam emails. The first model was built to maximize overall predictive accuracy, while the second model was built to minimize the average misclassification cost. The project utilized Decision Tree, KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest. The project was implemented using Python and libraries such as nltk, scikit-learn, and pandas.
