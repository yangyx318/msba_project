# msba_project

This is a repository containing three data analytics projects completed as part of the UMN MSBA program. Each project includes Jupyter notebooks and associated data files.

## Project 1: Analyze Disparities in Standard Testing
This project analyzed disparities in standardized test scores between different demographic groups. The project included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and statistical analysis using Python and various libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and scipy. The analysis revealed significant disparities in test scores among different demographic groups and provided insights into potential reasons for these disparities.

## Project 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
The second project focused on detecting credit card fraud within the banking industry. The dataset used for this project was both imbalanced and large in size. To tackle the class imbalance, I utilized SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to oversample the minority class. Afterwards, I constructed four machine learning models, specifically Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest, using the Databricks big data platform. This choice enabled efficient processing of large datasets within shorter timeframes. The project implementation involved the utilization of technologies such as PySpark, Pandas, and MLlib.

## Project 3: Customer Lifetime Value Prediction
The third project focused on predicting customer lifetime value (CLV) of credict card user for the banking industry. The project utilized machine learning techniques such as Bridge Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network to create a predictive model based on customer history. The project also included feature engineering and data visualization using Python and libraries such as scikit-learn and matplotlib.

## Project 4: Spam Email
The forth project involved building two different machine learning models for detecting and classify spam emails. The first model was built to maximize overall predictive accuracy, while the second model was built to minimize the average misclassification cost. The project utilized Decision Tree, KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest. The project was implemented using Python and libraries such as nltk, scikit-learn, and pandas.
